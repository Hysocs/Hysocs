<p align="center">
    I began my programming journey four years ago with JavaScript, creating scripts tailored for various tasks and applications. My insatiable curiosity led me to Lua, dedicating two years to honing my skills and crafting diverse functionalities. This hands-on experience paved the way for my introduction to Python, culminating in the development of <strong>CrossPixel</strong>, my inaugural Python project.
