<h2 align="center">📖 About Me 📖</h2>
<p align="center">
    I started programming four years ago with JavaScript, building scripts for various tasks and applications. My interest in exploring different technologies led me to Lua, where I spent two years developing a range of functionalities. This experience eventually brought me to Python, and I completed my first project, <strong>CrossPixel</strong>, using the language.

<h2 align="center">🔍 Specializations & Interests 🔍</h2>
<p align="center">
    I focus on writing efficient, streamlined code and always aim to design with the end-user in mind. Anticipating user needs and potential issues is a key part of my process, which is reflected in the stability of my Lua project, which has been running smoothly without errors for over a year. I prioritize thorough testing to ensure every feature is fully functional and reliable before release.
